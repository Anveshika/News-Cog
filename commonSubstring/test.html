<div id="playground">The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) surged to a massive win in the Delhi assembly polls on Tuesday, setting up a second stint for Arvind Kejriwal as chief minister and leaving the BJP licking its wounds in the city from which it rules the country.
 <br>
 <br>
The AAP was leading in 64 seats of the 70-member House, surpassing its own wildest expectations and beyond even the most optimistic exit polls, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) slumped to a distant second place with leads in just five seats.
